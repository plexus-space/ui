# Plexus UI Roadmap

> Building the definitive scientific visualization & physics component library for React

**Version:** 0.1.0
**Last Updated:** October 2025
**Architecture:** Radix-inspired primitives + shadcn copy-paste model

---

## 🎯 Vision

Create a comprehensive, scientifically accurate component library for physics, engineering, and scientific visualization that:

- **Provides fundamental building blocks** - Core primitives for electrical engineers, physicists, researchers, and operators
- **Owns the copy-paste model** - Like shadcn, users copy components to their projects
- **Enables infinite composition** - Radix-inspired primitives that work together seamlessly
- **Maintains scientific accuracy** - Real math from textbooks and standards
- **Balances performance & precision** - Fast by default, high-precision when needed
- **Spans disciplines** - Physics, EE, mechanical, aerospace, and beyond

**Who is this for?**

- 🔬 Research scientists visualizing experimental data
- ⚡ Electrical engineers designing RF systems and signal processing
- 🛰️ Satellite operators monitoring telemetry
- 🎓 Educators teaching physics and engineering concepts
- 📊 Data scientists working with scientific datasets
- 🎮 Game developers building simulation-heavy experiences

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Copy-Paste First

- ✅ Users own the code - no npm install for components
- ✅ CLI copies source files to user's project
- ✅ Full customization freedom
- ✅ No version lock-in
- ✅ Tree-shakeable by default

### Scientific Rigor

- All algorithms cite textbooks, standards, and peer-reviewed sources
- High-precision mode available for research applications
- Clear documentation of assumptions and limitations
- Unit-tested against known analytical solutions

#### 🔧 Developer Tools

- [x] CLI - Component installation and initialization

---

### 🎯 Goals

- Establish comprehensive 2D plotting foundation
- Add frequency domain and signal analysis tools
- Create fundamental scientific chart primitives

### Components

#### 📊 Core Scientific Charts

**`polar-plot`** - Polar coordinate plotting

```tsx
<PolarPlot
  data={antennaPattern}
  angleUnit="degrees" // or "radians"
  radiusLabel="Gain (dBi)"
  radiusScale="log" // or "linear"
  showGrid={{ radial: true, angular: true }}
  fillArea
  symmetry="none" // or "mirror", "rotational"
/>
```

**Use cases:** Antenna radiation patterns, directional data, circular statistics
