 * Plexus UI Utilities Library
 * Shared utilities for all components

 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import { cn, formatValue, EARTH_RADIUS_KM } from './lib';

// Note: theme.ts is kept as a separate file but not exported by default
// If you need theme utilities, import directly: import { theme } from './lib/theme';
